## Installation (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Icons

Before loading the extension, you need to create icon files:

1. Create a folder named `icons` inside the `SafeBrowsing-Extension` folder
2. You need three icon files (shield or lock design):

   * `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
   * `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
   * `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

**Quick Option:** Use an online icon generator:

* Visit: https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
* Create a shield emoji or text-based icon
* Download and rename the files
